# "End Cap" PCBs for OreSat

These are the "end cap" PCBs that attach to the +Z and -Z ends of the satellites. It's not clear what exactly
we're going to put on these boards besides magnetometers; there may be more in the future?

## Features

- Cutouts for deployable antennas
- Double magnetometers.
- Single vertical 10mm tall 1.27 mm connector that plugs into the "end card" card.
